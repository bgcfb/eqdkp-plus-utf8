EQdkp Plus Contributor Agreement v1.0:

Thank you for your interest in the open source software project EQdkp Plus 
(defined as all the GitHub repositories of the GitHub Organization EQdkp 
Plus (github.com/EQdkpPlus) and Sourceforge SVN Repository 
(svn.code.sf.net/p/eqdkp-plus) – the “Project”) maintained or managed by 
the EQdkp Core Developers (“us” or “EQdkp Plus”). The purpose of this 
Contribution Agreement (“Agreement”) is to define the intellectual property 
license granted by persons or entities that contribute code to us for the 
Project (“Contributions” and further defined below). If the Contribution is 
made on behalf of a company, the term “you” as used in this Agreement will 
mean the individual accepting this Agreement as well as the company employing 
such individual.

You hereby agree to the following terms and conditions:

1. Contributions: The term “Contribution” means any source code, object code, 
patch, tool, sample, graphic, specification, manual, documentation, or any 
other material posted or submitted by you to a Project.
A Contribution is “submitted” when any form of electronic, verbal, or written 
communication is sent to the Project, including but not limited to 
communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and 
issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Project for 
the purpose of discussing or improving software or documentation of the 
Project. Communication that is conspicuously marked or designated in writing 
by you as “Not a Contribution” will not be considered a Contribution. Any 
Contribution submitted by you to the Project will be under the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement without any additional terms or conditions.

2. Grant of License: 
You hereby grant to EQdkp Plus a non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, 
no-charge, transferable copyright license to use, execute, prepare derivative 
works of, and distribute  (in any form) your Contributions, including changes 
in accompanying documentation files and supporting files as well as changes in 
actual program code. 
The assignment shall also include any future revisions of these changes and 
enhancements hereafter made by you. This includes, at our option, the right to 
sublicense these same rights to third parties through multiple levels of 
sublicensees or other licensing or transfer arrangements.
You also agree that we may register a copyright in the Contribution and 
exercise all ownership rights associated with it; and you agree that neither 
of us has any duty to consult with, obtain the consent of, pay or render an 
accounting to the other for any use or distribution of the Contribution.
With respect to any patents you own, you hereby grant to EQdkp Plus and to 
the recipients of software distributed by EQdkp Plus a perpetual, irrevocable, 
non-exclusive, worldwide, full paid-up, royalty-free patent license to make, 
have made,use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer your 
Contribution in whole or in part, alone or in combination with or included in 
any product, work, derivative works or materials arising out of the Project, 
where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by you that 
are necessarily infringed by your Contribution alone or by combination of your 
Contribution with the Project to which you submitted the Contribution. This 
license includes, at our option, the right to sublicense these same rights to 
third parties through multiple levels of sublicensees or other licensing or 
transfer arrangements.

3. Ownership: Except as set out above, you keep all right, title and interest 
in your Contribution.
You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. If 
your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that 
includes your Contribution, you represent that you have received permission to 
make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived 
such rights for your Contributions to the Project, or that your employer has 
executed a separate Contribution Agreement with us.
You represent that your Contribution is an original work by you, and to your 
knowledge, no other person claims, or has the right to claim, any right 
whatsoever in the Contribution.
You represent and warrant that to the best of your knowledge, each Contribution 
will not violate any third party's copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other 
intellectual property rights.

4. Notice and Inclusion: You agree to notify us if you become aware of any 
circumstance which would make any of the foregoing representations inaccurate 
in any respect. The Project is under no obligation to accept and include every 
Contribution.

5. You are not expected to provide support for your Contributions, except to the 
extent you desire to provide support. Your may provide support for free, for a 
fee, or not at all. Your Contributions are provided as-is,  with all faults, 
defects and errors, and without any warranty of any kind (either express or 
implied)  including, without limitation, any implied warranty of merchantability 
and fitness for a particular  purpose and any warranty of non-infringement.
